**Blockchain facilitated energy exchange for open-grid applications**

meterBlock is a collaborative project that aims to provide a decentralised platform to facilitate the
governance of electrical energy consumption and production, measured and controlled by
Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) connected power meters. The goal of the project is to build
a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) prototype device running on the Ethereum blockchain to facilitate this
energy governance. The project commenced on the 1st of July 2018 and will run to completion
eight weeks later on the 26th of August 2018.

A primary use of this technology is to provide a platform of energy exchange between producers
and consumers within self-sustaining micro-grids, trading surplus energy between one another.
Full scale implementation involves replacing the current national gridâ€™s management system,
whereby each individual entity can act as both a consumer and producer, governed by the
blockchain, enabling a novel, trustless, decentralised, energy exchange marketplace. These
entities could include, but are not limited to: pure producer - such as power utilities (Eskom) - pure
consumer - such as manufacturing plants or traditional households - or producer/consumer - such
as gated communities, households, hospitals, shopping centres etc. with installed sources of
renewable energy.

The project will run on an Ethereum based blockchain (such as Quorum) and will implement the
tokenization of an energy unit through an adaptation of the ERC20 token standard.
meterBlock lays the foundations for future collaborative work when taken to its logical extreme at
a national grid level. This report discusses the inherent issues that must be considered before full
scale implementation of a DLT-based system can be put into production. Some of these issues
relate to the practicalities and complexities of implementation when considering application at a
national grid level, but can also be extended to the legal and regulatory factors and their broader
economic impacts.
